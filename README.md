# nodejs_simple_server

This project builds a simple server that only handles GET requests.

The purpose of this project was to get an idea of the fundamentals when 
it comes to setting up a server using only NodeJS and not NodeJS Express.

This project also impliments an Event Emitter which is used to log
errors and requests.
